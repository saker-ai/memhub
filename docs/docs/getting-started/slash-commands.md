# Slash Commands

Memoh bots support **slash commands** that are intercepted before the LLM runs. They are intended for fast inspection and control tasks such as viewing settings, switching providers, checking session status, or creating a fresh session.

Slash commands work in channel adapters and in the built-in Web UI chat. They do not consume model tokens just to parse the command itself.

---

## Command Model

Most commands follow a resource-group pattern:

```text
/resource [action] [arguments...]
```

Examples:

```text
/schedule list
/model current
/schedule create morning-news "0 9 * * *" "Send a daily summary"
```

Key ideas:

- **resource** is the command group, such as `schedule`, `model`, or `status`.
- **action** is the specific operation, such as `list`, `get`, `set`, or `latest`.
- **arguments** are positional values after the action. Use quotes when a value contains spaces.
- Some groups have a **default action**, so `/settings` is equivalent to `/settings get`, and `/status` is equivalent to `/status show`.

Two commands are **top-level** instead of resource groups:

- `/new` — create a new session for the current conversation route
- `/stop` — abort the currently running generation for the current conversation

---

## Built-in Help

The slash system has layered help built into it:

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show the top-level command list |
| `/help <group>` | Show actions inside one group |
| `/help <group> <action>` | Show detailed usage for one action |

Examples:

```text
/help
/help model
/help model set
```

This is the fastest way to discover the exact live command surface for your current Memoh version.

---

## Parsing Rules

Slash commands support a few convenience forms:

- **Mention-prefixed commands** work in group chats, for example `@BotName /help`.
- **Telegram bot suffixes** are accepted, for example `/help@MemohBot`.
- Quoted strings are preserved as one argument, for example:

```text
/schedule create morning-news "0 9 * * *" "Send today's top stories"
```

If the text does not resolve to a known command, Memoh treats it as a normal chat message instead of a slash command.

---

## Permissions

Read-only actions are available to users who can already chat with the bot. Write actions such as `set`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `enable`, and `disable` are **owner-only**.

In `/help` output, owner-only actions are marked with `[owner]`.

## Session Commands

### `/new`

Creates a fresh session for the current conversation route. It is the fastest way to reset conversational context without deleting old history.

Supported forms:

- `/new` — use the default session type for the current context
- `/new chat` — force a normal chat session
- `/new discuss` — force a discuss session

Default behavior:

- **Web UI local chat** defaults to `chat`
- **Direct messages** default to `chat`
- **Group conversations on channel adapters** default to `discuss`

`/new discuss` is not supported in the built-in Web UI local channel. Use a channel adapter such as Telegram or Discord if you want explicit discuss sessions.

See [Sessions](/getting-started/sessions) for how `chat` and `discuss` differ.

### `/stop`

Stops the current in-progress generation for the current conversation. This is useful when:

- the bot is still streaming and you already have what you need
- a tool loop is taking too long
- you want to interrupt the current turn before sending a follow-up

---

## Status And Inspection Commands

### `/status`

Shows session-level runtime stats for the current conversation:

- message count
- current context usage
- cache hit rate
- cache read/write tokens
- used skills in the session

Actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `show` | `/status` or `/status show` |
| `latest` | `/status latest` |

Use `show` for the currently active conversation route. Use `latest` when you want the newest session for the bot even if the current route has no active session.

### `/access`

Shows the current identity and permission context that Memoh is using for the command:

- channel identity
- linked user
- bot role
- whether write commands are allowed
- channel / conversation / thread scope
- evaluated chat ACL result

Usage:

```text
/access
```

This command is useful when debugging ACL rules or why a write command was denied.

### `/usage`

Shows token usage for the last 7 days.

Actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `summary` | `/usage` or `/usage summary` |

### `/heartbeat`

Shows the most recent heartbeat execution logs.

Actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `logs` | `/heartbeat` or `/heartbeat logs` |

### `/email`

Shows email-related configuration data for the current bot.

Actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `providers` | `/email providers` |

---

## Context Compaction Command

### `/compact`

Triggers immediate **session context compaction** for the current session. This is different from memory compaction:

- **context compaction** reduces the active prompt/history footprint of one session
- **memory compaction** rewrites long-term memory entries in the memory provider

Actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `run` | `/compact` or `/compact run` |

Use this when the current conversation has grown long and you want Memoh to summarize older turns before continuing. See [Context Compaction](/getting-started/compaction).
